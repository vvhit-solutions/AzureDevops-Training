# interview questions DevOps Engineer – 2  
**Experience:** 3–5 Years  
**Difficulty Level:** Hard – Practical Application & Advanced Problem Solving  

---

## Core Concepts to Be Covered

1. **Design & Architecture** (HLD, LLD, patterns, deployment design)  
2. **Security** (security patterns, overall security)  
3. **Performance & Scalability**  
4. **AWS & Cloud**  
5. **Delivery & Estimation** (timelines, estimation)  
6. **Operations** (observability, debugging, incidents, post-delivery bugs)  

---

## 1. CI/CD  
### Efficient Deployment Strategies

**Q.** Explain the deployment pipeline of the current project you are working on? Any special techniques used in them?  

**Q.** Creating optimized deployment pipelines for faster and reliable software delivery.  

**Q.** Given a scenario of microservice deployments to a K8s cluster, how would you design CI/CD so that the releases will be faster and software delivery will be reliable?  

**Q.** ArgoCD vs CD pipeline, would you consider GitOps approach for deployment?

## 2. Monitoring & Observability  

The candidate should have a strong understanding of tools such as OpenTelemetry, Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, etc., utilizing them to track, analyze, and visualize system performance and health metrics, diagnose issues, and ensure system reliability.  

**Q.** Given a microservice application, the API is responding slowly compared to previous track, how do you debug this issue in Grafana?  

**Q.** How do you configure custom metrics which I need to record for an application add-to-cart metric in Grafana?  

**Q.** Let’s say there is a P1 incident in production, how would you debug the issue with respect to the observability point?  

**Q.** Post-incident operations, what are the measures you will take so that the issue won’t repeat again from the ops perspective?

## 3. Scalability Design & Cloud Architecture  

The candidate should demonstrate a strong understanding of designing scalable systems, ensuring that the applications can handle increased workload and user demand.  

**Q.** Given a scenario of a highly available e-commerce application, where 500k+ users will use the application, how do you design this application for security, auto-scaling, in microservice architecture?  

**Q.** While you design a system to handle high traffic, how do you ensure we are not spending huge budgets on the infrastructure?  

**Q.** Explain different architecture designs followed by the industry to deploy production-grade workloads.

## 4. Task Tracking  

The candidate should ensure that the team works on the tasks and engages in daily stand-up meetings to track task progress, keep a check of project overview, foster collaboration, help the team stay aligned with sprint goals, and maintain a smooth workflow.  

**Q.** Given a scenario where you will handle a project with sprint goals, how do you ensure the work tasks are on track?  

**Q.** How do you ensure or plan the sprint to achieve the tasks by the end of the sprint?  

---

## 5. Cloud Architecture  

The candidate should have knowledge of cloud architecture design principles and best practices for building scalable and reliable cloud-based systems.  

**Q.** How do you design an active-active multi-region architecture for a global application following best practices?  

**Q.** How do you design a zero-downtime, highly available stateful application in a K8s cluster, in any cloud AWS or Azure?  

**Q.** I am promising my client that I will provide an SLA of 99.99 availability of the infrastructure. How do you design such infrastructure that can offer 99.99 availability?  

---

## 6. Cloud Security Implementation  

The candidate should apply security best practices to manage cloud infrastructure, including configuring IAM policies, securing networks with VPC and Security Groups, and ensuring compliance with cloud security standards.  

**Q.** While designing the cloud application, how do you ensure the security is taken care of for the cloud infrastructure?  

**Q.** What are the measures you would take on the K8s cluster to ensure security is in place?
